# What is PIX?

How to set up your pix key PIX is an instant payment solution created by Brazil’s Central Bank. It is free to use, instantaneous, and most importantly, secure. It was created to facilitate debit transfers in a way that, once the receiver is confirmed, the money is immediately debited from your bank and credited to the receiver’s account, regardless of time, place, or bank of destination.

There are several ways to use PIX. The main one is to fill in the receiver’s personal details, such as their full name, CPF (personal identification number), and account details. A simpler alternative to that method is to use a shortcut by registering a PIX key.

# What is a PIX Key?

A PIX key is a way to simplify how a bank identifies your account. They are unique, like digital fingerprints, and ensures agility and safety during transactions by providing the sender with a token to automatically fill in your details instead of manually typing them one by one.

You can possess up to 5 PIX keys, and each key you register needs to be associated with a financial account, such as a checking account or a payment account. Below, you will find a few examples of valid forms of PIX keys:

* Your CPF;
* Your personal phone number;
* A valid e-mail address;
* Or an _EVP_ or _Endereço Virtual de Pagamento_ (Virtual Payment Address), a randomly generated sequence of numbers and letters.

Each key you register can be shared with anyone from whom you intend to receive money. It does not compromise the safety of your personal details or account information.
