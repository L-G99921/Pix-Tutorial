# What is PIX?

PIX is an instant payment solution created by Brazil’s Central Bank. It is free to use, instantaneous, and most importantly, secure. It was created to facilitate debit transfers in a way that, once the receiver is confirmed, the money is immediately debited from your bank and credited to the receiver’s account, regardless of time, place or bank of destination.
